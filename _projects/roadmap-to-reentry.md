Help us convert a massive, valuable Word Document into a high-quality, accessible static website!

We've published [the first version of our site](http://roadmap.rootandrebound.org/)!

Every year, [Root & Rebound](http://www.rootandrebound.org/) publishes a resource entitled _Roadmap to Reentry: A California Legal Guide_ that helps currently and formerly incarcerated folks, their loved ones, and advocates work towards rebuilding lives. Root & Rebound manages to typeset and print [this massive 1000+ page book](https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/roadmapguide/RoadmapGuide-2016.pdf) from a single Microsoft Word document, and mail it to incarcerated people throughout California and beyond.

After deliberation about content management and publishing strategies, we've decided that the best way to put this content on the web is to convert the Word Document to a set of static HTML pages. We call this, the Roadmap to HTML.

See [our list of open github issues](https://github.com/rootandrebound/roadmap-to-html/issues) to learn about what's next for the project. [High-priority tasks](https://github.com/rootandrebound/roadmap-to-html/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22high+priority%22) are the most urgent.
