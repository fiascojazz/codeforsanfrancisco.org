Hey Code for SF, 

Coming from NYC where almost every neighborhood has their own local club, I was a bit sad that SF has very few. Running in groups can help motivate people to reach their fitness goals because of the social aspect. This is especially important for people in tech due to the sedentary nature of our work.

Currently, we have two events planned per week
1) Wednesday (6:30pm) Code at Civic Hack Night -- hacking! 
2) Thursday at 7pm at the SF Ferry Building -- run up the embarcadero, left on Bay St, left on Van Ness, right on Hayes to meet at Biergarten in Hayes Valley. 

We are looking for run leaders to add more runs per week. I used to lead a Saturday morning coffee run in NY which would be great for people who aren't available weeknights or prefer that to beer. We are also looking for folks who would like to open up their offices or coworking spaces one day or more per week for our group to do coding events (hackathons, teaching, or open source projects).
