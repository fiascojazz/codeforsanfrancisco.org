We Vote is a nonprofit, volunteer-driven movement, dedicated to bringing social collaboration to voting.

Welcome to We Vote, a project of Code for San Francisco (a Code for America Brigade) and We Vote USA. We Vote is the place to find your network's opinions on candidates and propositions before you vote, and share what you believe:

* follow the **voter guides** of trusted groups and thought leaders
* see voting recommendations **all the way down your ballot**
* easily **create your own voter guide**, showing which candidates and propositions you support
* discuss your views **with friends**
