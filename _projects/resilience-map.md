The Resilience Map project spun out of the National Day of Civic Hacking in an effort to find a solution for helping the SF Bay Area community to better prepare before a natural disaster. Weâ€™re currently working on creating an asset map to give neighborhood leaders the tools to prepare before a disaster strikes. The map is going to document city resources and later will be used by neighborhood leaders to create a digital archive of their neighborhood artifacts.
