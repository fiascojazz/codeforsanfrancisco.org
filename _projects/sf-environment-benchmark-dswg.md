The original goal of the SF Environment Benchmark project was to visualize building energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions to encourage owners and building managers to make proper changes. In addition we would like to analyze the data available to see if we can predict what energy consumption or emissions will be like in the future. We’ve currently developed a interactive map and an interactive dashboard to visualize this data. In addition, we’ll be meeting with the SF Department of Environment, who are the stewards of the data, to ensure these applications have met their needs and look for more problems to solve.

**This is a project of the Data Science Working Group at Code for San Francisco.**
