(Transportation Regulation & Infrastructure Pipeline for San Francisco)
Knowledge about changes to transportation regulation and infrastructure in areas of public right of way such as our streets and sidewalks, is of interest to a wide variety of individuals and organizations, but can be hard to find. We want to make this information easier to access by developing a pipeline to track the processing of proposals and to facilitate communication about them. Our focus will be on the locations for vehicle and pedestrian movement on streets and sidewalks.
