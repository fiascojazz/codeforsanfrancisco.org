Every project needs good user research to maximize their chances of making the biggest impact possible, but the format of weekly Hack Nights doesn’t always afford the time to plan and implement a solid user research campaign. And experience has shown that user research is an activity many members might not know much about or maybe isn’t high on their list of skills they want to master. NLTweets has a mission to provide projects with a tool that will let them accomplish valuable user research data in one night, and with continued study of their domain problem, meaningful insights over time.
