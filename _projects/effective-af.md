**Effective.af: making activists 10x more powerful via ultra effective communities of action and autonomous software.**

_Ready to start harnessing the power of the internet to allow thousands of projects and millions of people to join forces to change the world?_

The short-term goal is for Effective to enable participants to: create a **project** with a name and mission, create a **hierarchy of tasks** that build up to the achievement of that mission, **invite others by URL** (without requiring invitees to hand over their email address to the server), optionally **invite others into specific roles** (with a title and associated task list), ask for help or clarify the assigned tasks in **per-task chat rooms**, attach **files and documents** to tasks, **get summoned** when relevant events occur (e.g., when you are assigned a task, or when mentioned), receive **social recognition** for contributions (via karma points), and **assign tasks _to other projects_** in this ecosystem in order to harness its collective expertise and desire to change the world.

Effective can be used for a great many things.  But we, its creators, have certain interests.  Specifically, we are focused on organizing activists, non-profits, and projects tackling grand challenges in order to help solve serious problems we face as a society and fight for a better future for all.

In addition to fighting for this more prosperous future, we aim to confront and correct, via an energetic, global network of forward-thinking individuals, the injustices imposed on society by criminalized institutions the world over.
