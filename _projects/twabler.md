Organizations with talented members but few resources are effectively deprived of the benefits of machine learning due to the high cost of obtaining good training data (labeled data). We are building a mobile application that will allow projects to distribute labeling jobs to volunteers who can perform the tasks wherever they are whenever they have free time and a smart phone.
