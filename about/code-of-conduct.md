description: The Code for San Francisco community Code of Conduct.
---

# Code for San Francisco is a space for everyone.

What does that mean?
- We **value** the people here and make everyone feel **welcome**
- We **make room** for all brigade members to engage, discuss, and collaborate
- We **support each other** to build a strong civic tech community
- We **respect** the boundaries of others

These are not just statements of belief, but principles that we collectively enact. We are dedicated to upholding them,
and to ensuring that all members of our community respect them.

Below, you’ll find the full text of our Code of Conduct, with more detailed information about our community principles.
You’ll also find our harassment policy, along with information about who to contact if you think the policy has been
violated. For other questions about the Code of Conduct, or about our brigade, reach out to [hello@codeforsanfrancisco.org](mailto:hello@codeforsanfrancisco.org).

## Code of Conduct

The Code for America community expects that Code for San Francisco activities and events:

0. Are a safe and respectful environment for all participants.
0. Are a place where people are free to fully express their identities.
0. Presume the value of others. Everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions have value.
0. Don’t assume everyone has the same context, and encourage questions.
0. Find a way for people to be productive with their skills (technical and not) and energy. Use language such as
   “yes/and”, not “no/but.”
0. Encourage members and participants to listen as much as they speak.
0. Strive to build tools that are open and free technology for public use. Activities that aim to foster public use, not
   for private gain, are prioritized.
0. Prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process.
0. Work to ensure that all demographics present in the community are represented.
0. Actively involve community groups and those with subject matter expertise in the decision-making process.
0. Ensure that the relationships and conversations between community members, the local government staff and community
   partners remain respectful, participatory, and productive.
0. Provide an environment where people are not subjected to discrimination or harassment.  Code for San Francisco
   reserves the right to ask anyone in violation of these policies not to participate in Code for San Francisco events
   or network activities.

## Anti-Harassment Policy
<em>
  This anti-harassment policy is based on [the example
  policy](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy) from the Geek Feminism wiki, created by
  the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.
</em>

<em>
  This policy is based on several other policies, including the Ohio LinuxFest anti-harassment policy, written by Esther
  Filderman and Beth Lynn Eicher, and the Con Anti-Harassment Project. Mary Gardiner, Valerie Aurora, Sarah Smith, and
  Donna Benjamin generalized the policies and added supporting material. Many members of LinuxChix, Geek Feminism and
  other groups contributed to this work.
</em>

Code for San Francisco is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender
identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. We do
not tolerate harassment of staff, presenters, and participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not
appropriate for any Code for San Francisco event or network activity, including talks. Anyone in violation of these
policies may expelled from Code for San Francisco network activities, events, and digital forums, at the discretion of
the event organizer or forum administrator.

Harassment includes but is not limited to: offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, gender identity and
expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion; sexual images in public
spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks
or other events; inappropriate physical contact; unwelcome sexual attention; unwarranted exclusion; and patronizing
language or action.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
warning the offender or expulsion from Code for San Francisco network activities, events, and digital forums.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please tell one of
the organizers what you experienced or witnessed:

* Core Team, [hello@codeforsanfrancisco.org](mailto:hello@codeforsanfrancisco.org)

Event staff or forum administrators will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local
law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the
event.

If you cannot reach an event organizer or forum administrator and/or it is an emergency, please call 911 and/or remove
yourself from the situation.

You can also contact Code for America about harassment at
[safespace@codeforamerica.org](mailto:safespace@codeforamerica.org) and feel free to use the email template below. Code
for America staff acknowledge that we are not always in a position to evaluate a given situation due to the number of
events and the fact that our team is not always present. However, we are hopeful that by providing these guidelines we
are establishing a community that jointly adheres to these values and can provide an environment that is welcoming to
all.

We value your attendance and hope that by communicating these expectations widely we can all enjoy a harassment-free
environment.
